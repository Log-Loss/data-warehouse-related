# Web Crawler All in One

I'm happy to announce that I've got almost all the functions in this project

## To Go
* **Replace the [your mongoDB Atlas url] in DB/atlas.py with the one I provided**

* set up a local mongoDB without authentication

* run `run_proxypool.py` first, after several minutes, then run `run_crawler.py`
